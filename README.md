# Threat Intelligence

## Overview
This repository documents my work learning **threat intelligence** and applying it to **detection, risk assessment, and security operations**.

The focus is on understanding:
- How adversaries operate
- What signals their behavior generates
- How detections, controls, and frameworks reduce real risk

Rather than listing threats, this repo connects **adversary behavior** to **telemetry, detections, and security controls** used in production environments.

---

## Core Focus Areas
- Adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- Mapping threat behavior to logs and detection ideas
- Using security frameworks to assess risk and control gaps
- Supporting detection engineering, audits, and threat modeling

---

## Frameworks & Standards Used
This repository references widely used security frameworks to ground threat intelligence in real-world practice:

- **MITRE ATT&CK** – Adversary behavior and TTP mapping  
- **NIST CSF / NIST 800-53** – Risk management and security controls  
- **CIS Critical Security Controls** – Prioritized defensive actions  
- **ISO/IEC 27001** – Information security management practices  
- **HIPAA** – Healthcare data protection considerations  
- **GDPR (EU)** – Privacy and data protection principles  
- **PCI DSS** – Protection of payment and sensitive data  

These frameworks are used to **contextualize risk**, not to copy requirements.

## How This Repo Is Used
The notes in this repository are designed to:
- Inform **detection engineering**
- Support **risk assessments**
- Guide **threat modeling discussions**
- Improve alert quality and investigative context
- Connect security operations to compliance and governance goals
